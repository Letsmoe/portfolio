# Meta

Meta is a compiler generator originally inspired by [META-II](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800257.808896).

I improved on the syntax of it immensely though and it's now almost unrecognizable.

It was a lot of fun writing my own compiler and support for a few languages. I learned how to:

- Write a Compiler
- Understand Assembly
- Write a Compiler for Intermediate Representation
- Write my own Intermediate Representation
- Write a bytecode compiler

and so much more!

You can check out Meta for yourself, clone the source code and tinker with it. That's what open source is for after all!
