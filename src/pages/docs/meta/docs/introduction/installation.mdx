Installing Meta is very straightforward, just follow these instructions and you'll be set up in no time!

<Note>
	Meta requires NodeJS and npm / pnpm / Yarn to be preinstalled. If you haven't done that already follow the instructions over at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
</Note>

To install Meta with npm run this command:

```sh
npm install -g @metalang/core @metalang/cli @metalang/debug-cli
```

This will install all necessary components you need to start writing compilers! Let's get started, shall we?

You can use the command line interface we just installed to set up a new
project, this will run you through the process of setting everything up.

```sh
meta init -t=default
```
