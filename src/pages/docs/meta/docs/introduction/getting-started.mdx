Welcome to Meta, a compiler writing language written in TypeScript and Gyro.
Meta-II was designed in [1964 by Val Schorre](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800257.808896). The version we call Meta today was inspired by its idea but greatly overhauled to better fit the needs of today's developers and engineers.
The syntax is significantly easier to understand and offers some creature comforts such as [inline calculations](./inline-calculations), [variables](./variables), [constants](./constants) and much more!
Just compare the syntax of the two side by side. 


On the left you can see the Meta-II syntax from 1964 and on the right the Meta syntax from today.

<div class="flex flex-row gap-4">

AS = .ID .OUT('address ' *) ':=' EX1 .OUT('store') ';' .,
EX1 = EX2 $('+' EX2 .OUT('add') /
            '-' EX2 .OUT('sub') ) .,
EX2 = EX3 $('*' EX3 .OUT('mpy') /
            '/' EX3 .OUT('div') ) .,
EX3 = EX4 $('^' EX3 .OUT('exp')) .,

Don't worry if you don't understand either one of these examples. You will by the end of this documentation.
